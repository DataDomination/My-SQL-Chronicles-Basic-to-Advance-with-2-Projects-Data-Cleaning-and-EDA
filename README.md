# My-SQL-Chronicles-Basic-to-Advance-with-2-Projects-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA

📘 SQL Chronicles – Project 6
SQL Chronicles Project-6 is a multi-stage, full-stack SQL project designed to transform messy, unstructured data into powerful analytical insights.
Using advanced SQL techniques, automation features, and exploratory data analysis, this project uncovers meaningful patterns from the Worldwide Layoffs Dataset.

✅ Project Overview
This project demonstrates complete SQL proficiency, covering:
• Data cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing
• Transforming raw datasets into structured, reliable tables
• Advanced querying using joins, subqueries, unions, and filters
• Analytical SQL using CASE, string functions, and window functions
• Data automation through CTEs, temp tables, stored procedures, triggers, and events
• A full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global layoffs

🧩 Project Structure
✅ Project 1: Data Cleaning, Wrangling & Preprocessing

Goal: Transform messy, inconsistent data into a clean and analysis-ready dataset.

Key Operations:
• Identifying and removing duplicates
• Fixing inconsistent company, industry, and country labels
• Standardizing date formats
• Handling missing or null values
• Using CTEs for step-by-step cleaning logic
• Using TEMP tables for staging transformations
• Creating a fully cleaned dataset for EDA
• Skills Demonstrated by multiple techniques utilized for optimizing the data set
• CTE-based cleaning
• TEMP tables & staging environments
• Data normalization
• Column-level transformations
• Data integrity validation

✅ Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Worldwide Layoffs

Goal: Discover global layoff trends across industries, companies, regions, and years.

Key Insights Explored:
• Year-over-year layoffs
• Industry-wise impact (Tech, Finance, Retail, Startups, etc.)
• Country-wise layoffs and economic signals
• Highest layoffs by organization
• Layoff percentage vs. company size
• Understanding global economic patterns through SQL

Techniques Used
• Aggregations & grouping
• Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
• Subqueries for insight extraction
• Advanced filtering & segmentation
• Trend analysis using date-based functions

🛠️ Technical Stack
• SQL (MySQL)
• CTEs
• TEMP Tables
• Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
• Subqueries & Nested Queries
• String & Date Functions
• CASE Statements
• Window Functions
• Stored Procedures
• Triggers & Events

🎯 Project Mission
To turn raw SQL queries into real-world business intelligence.
While anyone can query data, only a few can command, shape, and interpret it at scale.
SQL Chronicles Project-6 demonstrates that complete journey—from chaos to clarity.
